# UnrealBlueprintsGameLogicsExamples
Created a simple parts of a separated game logic on a Unreal Blueprint, just for lulz


I was wondering about visual programming on Blueprints. And I decided to learn Unreal Blueprints. It was fun.

To check my level and logics run "MyProject" on Unreal, and load "2ndWeekMap" (on a first week I just played with editor and learn UI on UE).
